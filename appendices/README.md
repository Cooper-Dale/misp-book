# Appendix A: External Authentication

#### The external authentication mechanism described

The external authentication allows a user or an external tool to authenticate with MISP using an arbitrary value passed along in a custom header. This authentication method overrides the regular authentication mechanisms and is customisable by a site-admin. 

It is possible to create a mixed mode MISP setup where certain users can go through the normal authentication mechanism and other users are required to use the external authentication method.

#### Setting up the external authentication mechanism

To change the authentication settings, navigate to Administration - Server settings - Plugin settings

The settings associated with the external authentication can be found by pressing the CustomAuth button as depicted below:

![The server settings relevant to the Custom Authentication system.](figures/a/settings.png)

To change a setting simply double click on the value to edit the field. Use the guidance provided by the setting tool to configure the external authentication. The accessible settings are as follows:

*   **enable**: Enable or disable external authentication (off by default)

*   **header**: The header which MISP will use to identify users

*   **required**: Enabling this setting will force all users to use the external authentication. Leave this disabled allows administrators to assign external authentication or regular authentication users.

*   **only_allow_source**: Setting a url / IP address here will only allow requests that originated from the given address

*   **name**: The name to be used for the authentication mechanism. This is reflected in the user creation / edit views, the logs and the error messages on failed logins.

*   **disable_logout**: Disable the default logout button. Using an external authentication mechanism that authenticates via the header with each requests makes the logout button obsolete. 

*   **custom_password_reset**: If your authentication system has a url that a user can access to reset his/her password, please specify the full url for it here. This will then be reused in the UI.

*   **custom_password_logout**: If your authentication system has a url that a user can access to logout, please specify the full url for it here. This will then be reused in the UI.

#### User management

Using a new setting, user self management can be disabled for all users that are not administrators via the MISP.disableUserSelfManagement setting, found in the MISP settings tab. Enabling this setting removes the ability of users to change their user settings and reset their authentication keys. All other functionality remains unchanged.

![Adding a user with the external authentication enabled.](figures/a/add_user.png)

To create an external authenticated user, simply tick the External authentication user checkbox, after which an external auth key field will appear. This will be used to identify the users via the passed along header. 

#### Logging

For a description of the logging facilities provided by this plugin, please refer to the "Logging of failed authentication attempts" section of the Administration section.

# Appendix B: ACL descriptors

#### Querying the ACL system

MISP allows site admins to query the ACL system for various types of data. This can be interesting when tuning for example WAF access to MISP. All applicable queries can be requested via /servers/queryACL

#### Getting a list of URLs accessible to a role

~~~~
https://<misp url>/servers/queryACL/printRoleAccess/<role id>
~~~~

The above URL will return a JSON with all accessible URLs for the given role ID. If no Role ID is provided, a JSON containing all roles and their access lists will be returned. 

Example:

~~~~json
{
    "3": {
        "name": "User",
        "urls": [
            "/*/restSearch",

# Appendix F: LDAP Authentication

MISP supports LDAP authentication from version 2.4.xxx. This manual will show how to configure LDAP authentication. 

#### Installation and configuration

1. Install `mod_ldap` PHP module
    ```bash
    # for Centos or RHEL
    yum install rh-php72-php-ldap
    # for Ubuntu or debian
    apt install php-ldap
    ```
2. Prepare variables for configuration

* `{{ LDAP_SERVER }}` – a full LDAP URI of server. For example: `ldap://example.com`.
* `{{ LDAP_BASE_DN }}` – DN for path that contains users. For example: `cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com`.
* `{{ LDAP_BIND_DN }}` – user that can read. For example: `uid=misp,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=example,dc=com`.
* `{{ LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD }}` – password for that user.
* `{{ LDAP_USER_GROUP }}` – group with access to MISP. For example: `cn=misp-users,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com`.
   
3. Configure MISP ApacheSecureAuth in `app/Config/config.php`

    ```php
    'LdapAuth' => array(
      'enabled' => true,
      'name' => 'My Identity provider',
      'ldapServer' => '{{ LDAP_SERVER }}',
      'ldapDN' => '{{ LDAP_BASE_DN }}',
      'ldapSearchFilter' => '(objectclass=inetuser)',
      'ldapReaderUser' => '{{ LDAP_BIND_DN }}',
      'ldapReaderPassword' => '{{ LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD }}',
      'ldapUserGroup' => '{{ LDAP_USER_GROUP }}',
      'updateUser' => true,
    );
    ```

Required variables:

* `enabled` – if it is true, all users must log in through LDAP account.
* `ldapServer` – a full LDAP URI of the form ldap://hostname:port or ldaps://hostname:port for TLS encryption.
* `ldapDN` – DN for a path that contains users.

Optional variables:

* `name` – identity provider name. Will be shown in the login screen and user editing for. Can contain HTML.
* `ldapReaderUser` – DN or RDN LDAP user with permission to read LDAP information about users.
* `ldapReaderPassword` – password for that user.
* `ldapSearchFilter` - LDAP search filter.
* `ldapSearchAttribute` - LDAP attribute that contains username. Default: `uid`.
* `ldapEmailField` - LDAP attribute (string) or attributes (array) that will be checked if contains user e-mail address. If you want to change or add field, you should also add that field/fields to `ldapAttributes`. Default: `mail`.
* `ldapAttributes` – fields that will be fetched from LDAP server. Default: `mail` and `memberof`.
* `ldapUserGroup` - LDAP group that must be assigned to user to access MISP. Default: not set.
* `createUser` - if `true`, MISP will create new user from LDAP. Default `true`.
* `updateUser` - if `true`, MISP will update existing users information (e-mail address and role) from LDAP after login. Default: `false`.
* `ldapDefaultOrg` – default organization ID for user from LDAP. By default it is the first organization in the database.
* `ldapDefaultRoleId` - default role for newly created user. It can be integer or array when key contains LDAP group and value assigned role ID. Must be defined if `updateUser` is set to `true` (without that variable, user will be disabled).
* `ldapProtocol` - protocol version used. Default: 3.
* `ldapNetworkTimeout` - timeout for communication with LDAP server in seconds. Default: 5 seconds.
* `ldapAllowReferrals` - follow referrals returned by the LDAP server. Default: `false`.
* `ldapStartTls` - enable STARTTLS. Default: `true`.

#### Debugging

Setting LDAP authentication can be sometimes tricky. For debugging, you can check MISP error log (by default in `/var/www/MISP/app/tmp/logs/error.log`) or debug log (by default in `/var/www/MISP/app/tmp/logs/debug.log`) that can contain useful information with problem description.

#### Migrating existing user to LDAP

Because LDAP and MISP users are paired by e-mail address, it is possible to migrate existing user account to LDAP managed. When you enable LDAP support and LDAP user will try to log in, an existing user in MISP with the same e-mail address will be found and then assigned to LDAP user.

#### Caveats

* When a user is disabled in LDAP or is removed from the required group, it will be not automatically disabled in MISP. That means that user will be disabled when he tries to login (with form or with Auth key), but for example, notification e-mails will still work until he tries to log in.
* When a user is disabled in LDAP and also in MISP and then enabled in LDAP, it will be enabled in MISP for next login just when `updateUser` is set to `true`.
* Currently it is not possible to log in with both LDAP and local (MISP) accounts.
* Admins can change users email address. But when `updateUser` is set to true, when the user will log in again, the e-mail address will be updated from LDAP.
* `Security.require_password_confirmation` setting currently does not work with LDAP authentication. But on the other hand, since user cannot change e-mail address and password, this setting is not important.
